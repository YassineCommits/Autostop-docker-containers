Description: Stops idle Nomad jobs based on Docker container network activity.
 This service monitors running Docker containers managed by HashiCorp Nomad.
 If a container (optionally matching a filter) exhibits network inactivity
 (based on docker stats Rx/Tx) for a configurable duration, the service
 attempts to stop the corresponding Nomad job via the Nomad API.
 .
 This is useful for automatically shutting down development environments,
 temporary services, or other jobs that should not run indefinitely when idle,
 helping to conserve resources.
 .
 Configuration is done by editing /etc/default/nomad-idle-monitor and
 restarting the service (sudo systemctl restart nomad-idle-monitor).
 You MUST provide the Nomad API endpoint and token in the configuration file.
